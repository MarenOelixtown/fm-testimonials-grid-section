### Links

- Live Site URL: [Testimonials grid section / Vercel deployment](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have not only initialised CSS custom properties in :root but also within class-selectors to style individual border-colors for images.

### Continued development

I want to utilise the power of CSS custom properties more in the future and find out when it makes sense to use them but at the same time not to overdo it.

### Useful resources

- [ CSS Custom Properties](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-custom-properties/)
